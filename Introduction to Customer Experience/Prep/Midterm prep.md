# Introduction

Working in hospitality industry is very difficult. One needs to deliver excellence in customer experience to increase customer retention and advocacy for ones business model. I as a general manager of my restaurant want to build a strong bond between my establishment and my customers. To do this I and my team have decided to use 6 Customer Experience frameworks to deliver refined experience fit for a luxury dining restaurant. 

# CX Frame Works

## I Trust You
Starting with the most important framework, to initiate the relationship with our dear customer is "I Trust You" framework. This framework highlights the importance of trust as underlying foundation for our customer experience which is crucial for its development.  To show the customer that we are trust worthy business our team is going to provide clear and concise description of every meal, its ingredients and have our chef who is going to cook the guests meal. On our website you will also have the suppliers information fully visible in a special section, so that our customer knows we are ethically sourcing our ingredients. We want our customer to see the effort we put in for them and how much we want to advance further together with them. But trust is a two way street, we also want to trust the customer so we will try to get to know the customer better.

## I Know You
Next on the list is "I Know You" strategy. Knowing your customer is very important, from their general information to more in detail, like their birthdate, food preferences, allergies and maybe unique peculiarities. Knowing what the customer wants will greatly improve our customer experience quality by providing a more personalised service. Each of our customers is unique individual and we will not sleep on them. By just being our customer they deserve being treated by their name, with respect. We remember what our customer likes, dislikes. We remember who our customer is. We have the tools necessary and we use them, to store their information. The employees will avoid recommending meals deemed unfit for the guest, based on their tastes or allergies. 

## You make it easy
We make it easy for our guest. Precise description of each meals prepares the guest for unparalleled dinning experience. We are developing each meal personally and publishing updates daily on out social media posts. Our guest know what to expect and sometimes allow us to surprise them with a weekly chefs special menu item. To make a reservation for the next time, the guest can approach any waiter on duty, or just simply click on our online website. It is simple with no difficulties, our customer is valued and we will always be eager to greet them, be it their first or next time. the customer may expect easy payment solutions, private parking and intuitive navigation on the website, for their convenience. 

## You Get Me
We strife understand our customers - we remember them and we also adapt to their needs. Our staff is specially trained to recognize irregularities and is obligated to informing management if a guest seems unwell. We go above and beyond to lift their spirits, whether through complimentary entry, a refreshing drink, or a thoughtful gesture. We take pride in celebrating our guests’ personal victories, sharing in their joy at every milestone. Whenever they return, we strive to create the perfect atmosphere for their celebrations, whether personal or professional, ensuring every experience feels exceptional. The atmosphere must suit the purpose of visit and employees will make it fit the guest needs no matter what. Seamless decorations, arranged seating and even a private dinning room are all to be provided.
(The word choice is mine, but AI did go over the paragraph to make it smoother. I was a bit confused on how to connect the celebration and professional setting together.)

## You deliver on your promise
We promise our customer the best dinning experience. It is in our best interest to assure highest quality service as fast as we possibly can. We always deliver the best, at our hardest. That is our promise the to the guest. Our customer may expect on the dot what they see on the menu and or social media. The customer is entitled to hear about the dish from our employees, to make them eagerly anticipate their first bite of the dish. Each meal is done by the head chef and some of the preparations are done a few days ahead even. The kitchen staff undergoes screening each three months to prove that they are capable of providing only the highest quality assurance for the dinner.

## You fix things
And of course, our restaurant always rectifies the mistakes me wake. To do this, we need to ask the guest what exactly is the problem . Then we deliver a heartfelt apology no matter what. I will come down myself to deliver an apology alongside the employee who caused the problem. After collecting feedback we can start working on the solution to the problem. Be it reduction of the fee, a free desert or remake of the dish, our customer needs to understand that we will go many length for them to feel our apology.  We are not running a soulless machine here. We care for our customer. After the problem is resolved and solution is delivered we will follow up on our guest and ask them if they liked it or not.

# Conclusion
Together these six strategies form a positive customer experience. Only this way can we as a team make our customer trust us and become our dear family members in this tight knit business. In return our guest will become our advocates, telling stories of how fond our guest are of us. It is important aspect in todays culture with how rich and oversaturated the world is with information of all kinds. Customer advocacy is the most efficient way for us to attract more customers. Only together, customer and the business can we move forward, it is an exchange of experience, not only money that a business in hospitality sphere provides.
