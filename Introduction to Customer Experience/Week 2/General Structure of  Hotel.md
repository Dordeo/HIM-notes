# Role of Trust

[[Terminology/Words of power/Customer Experience]] - emotions from every interaction on every channel of customer to business interactions.

[[Customer Service]] - the functional elements a company provides to its customer before, during and after product or service is bought.

Customer Experience is emotional while Customer Service is functional. 

Whenever customers experience a good emotion from a business they build trust. the buildup of trust is in the Emotional Piggybank. Whenever Customer feels bad emotion from the experience the Emotional Piggybank breaks. And then the customer leaves because he no longer feels appreciated.
