THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON OBSIDIAN AND GIT HUB VERSION CONTROL
You are required to install Obsidian and git bash FOR PC for everything else idk

Before you do anything download Obsidian and download this repository(AKA this collection of Notes)

To download it you need to first open git bash
if you don't have it, get it.

the commands are simple and I am going to read them out here

first since git bash is console based programme you want understand the following:
cd "Folder name" - this command will move you to the folder in your current system folder
ls - will list all folders you can move up to
cd .. - will move you back a folder until you reach a zero point AKA disc selection

Using these 3 commands you can go into any folder you want
I recommend creating a folder called Obsidian Vaults where you want to store this repository

to start the git hub for THE FIRST TIME you HAVE TO use command git init

IF YOU have used git init command ALREADY do not use it agian it will fail
