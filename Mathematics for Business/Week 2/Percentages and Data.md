# Goals

 - Understand percentages and ratios
 - Apply them
 - Interpret and Present Data

## Why Percentages are important

Rations and percentages are the universal language of mathematics that transform random data into insights. From complex information into usable/malleable information.

[[ Ratio ]] - comparison of two numbers

Ratios eliminate the confusion of absolute numbers by showing relationships. They make data comparable across different scales and time periods.

Examples of Ratios are :
[[Debt-to-Equity (debt over equity)]], [[Current Ratio (Current assets over current liabilities)]], [[Price-to-Earnings Ratio]]

Price-to-Earnings Ratio = Compares stock price to earnings per share, helping investors evaluate if a stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to industry standards.

## Ratios in Marketing

Companies use ratios to compare their sales against competitors. A 3:2 ratio against the closest competitor indicates 60% vs 40% market dominance, revealing competitive positioning and growth opportunities.

Customer satisfaction surveys. Good vs Bad reviews. The higher the value of the ratio the better.

Digital marketers track visitor-to-customer ratios. A 50:1 ratio means 2% conversion rate, helping optimize advertising spend and website performance to improve business outcomes.

## Data

Data can be presented in multiple ways. In reality the base concept is the same: Comparison. Ratios are the most common way to represent the date as they are exactly the epitome of comparison. There are also graphs and charts. Be they PI Charts or Linear graphs. 

## [[Componendo - Dividendo rule]] 

Ok this is going to be funny. It basically allows you to solve some equations much faster. Me personally I would still use substitution but you have  to track everything there but lets check on this example

If Company A's revenue-to-cost ratio is 5:3, and we know total financial flow is $800,000. Calculate [[Profit Margin]]. Profit Margin is Profit over Revenue btw. And Profit is Revenue minus Costs

	Given Revenue + Costs = 800 000 and Revenue / Costs = 5 : 3
	
1) Revenue / Costs = 5 / 3
2) (Revenue + Costs) / (Revenue - Costs) = (5 + 3)/(5 - 3)
	 
	 No need to look for Revenue and Costs Separately lets find (Revenue - Costs) first as it is needed to calculate Profit Margin
	 
3) (Revenue - Costs) = (Revenue + Costs) * (5 - 3) / (5 + 3)
4) Revenue - Costs = 800 000 * 2 / 8 = 200 000
5) Revenue  = (Revenue + Costs + (Revenue - Costs)) / 2 = (800 000 + 200 000) / 2 = 500 000
6) Profit margin = 200 000 / 500 000 = 0.4 = 40%

Answer: 40 %

## Other necessary formulas

### Markup Formula
 Selling Price = Cost + (Cost × Markup %)
 Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost) ÷ Cost × 100

### Discount Calculation
Discount % = (Original - Sale Price) ÷ Original × 100
Sale Price = Original × (1 - Discount %)
