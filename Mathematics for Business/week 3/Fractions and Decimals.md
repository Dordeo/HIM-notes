[[Fraction]] - represents a part of a whole, written as numerator/denominator. In business, fractions help us understand ownership, market share, and proportional relationships.

## Key components
Numerator - the number of parts we have
Denominator - the number of parts that make up the whole

# Importance

Even the smallest number have high importance

a 0.01% interest rate on a 1 million $ investment will result in 100$ dollars payout every year. Therefore even the smallest of decimals can not be ignored. 

# Rounding over Truncating

Truncating is basically ignoring the rest of the number and just leaving it be for the rest of time. Causes a lot of underestimation as an error.

Rounding however takes that part of the number into account and gives it credit based on the parts value: if it is bigger that 5 in most front digit, it gets rounded up else rounded down.
Can cause underestimation, but when it does underestimation is most of the time irrelevant. However in some cases it may cause overestimation. 

NEVER ever truncate, better to Round. Overestimation is always better then underestimation.

## Why approximation matters

1. Speed - it is fast
2. Communication - rounded number are better able to be communicate
3. Focus - helps understand what precision is required for the job.

### Compound interest
Compound interest is calculated by this following formula
$$
A = P(1 + r)^n
$$
A = Final amount
P = Initial Investment or Principal
r = Interest rate
n = amount of periods
