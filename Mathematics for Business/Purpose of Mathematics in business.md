# Learning Objectives

- Learn to do simple math's
- Moodle and Moodle handbook
- Mathematics are required for other fields
- calculate return  on investments

# Importance of Mathematics

 - Finance : Calculate compound interest, analyze investment returns, assess risk through statistical models, and create financial forecasts that guide strategic decisions.
 - Marketing : Measure campaign effectiveness, calculate customer acquisition costs, analyze market share percentages, and optimize pricing strategies through demand analysis.
 - Economics : Understand supply and demand curves, calculate elasticity coefficients, analyze market equilibrium, and interpret economic indicators for business planning.
 - Accounting : Prepare financial statements, calculate depreciation schedules, analyze cost-volume-profit relationships, and ensure accurate financial reporting
# Learning Outcomes

Learn how to do basic math with its concepts. Use analytical thinking and go for overall real life applications and related skills.
# Mathematics Core 

- Statistics (data distributions)
- Arithmetic (percentages specifically)
- Equations and functions (linear and quadratic)
- Financial predications (predict future and estimate present values)

# Important Concepts

[[ROE (Return on equity)]]
[[Current Ratio (Current assets over current liabilities)]]
[[Debt-to-Equity (debt over equity)]]

[[Operating costs]] = Fixed Costs(rent for example) + Variable Costs (Number of employees * their salary, materials bought)

# Problem solving steps

Identify a problem
Gather and Analyze the data
Create and implement solution

# Real life applications

Revenue analysis - the company analyzes the revenue chart graph and finds out something called breaking point, then identifying a pattern and coming up with a solution.

Investment Decisions - calculate something like ROI, customer lifetime value($ amount a customer will bring on average), conversion rates to then make a estimate of how much budget needs to be allocated to increase profit and minimize risk

Inventory optimization - basically calculating how much inventory you can hold to accommodate any potential customer needs while minimizing the amount of money spent on the preservation of this inventory
