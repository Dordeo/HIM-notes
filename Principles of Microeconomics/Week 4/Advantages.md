# Interdependence and Gains from Trade

### Core Concepts

- People are better off when they specialize and trade → leads to [[economic interdependence]]
- [[Opportunity cost]] differences determine patterns of production and trade
- [[Absolute advantage]]: fewer inputs needed to produce a good
- [[Comparative advantage]]: lower opportunity cost in producing a good
- Gains from trade arise from comparative advantage, not absolute advantage
- [[Terms of trade]] must fall between each party’s opportunity costs to be mutually beneficial
- Trade expands the [[consumption possibilities frontier]] beyond self-sufficiency

### Trade Example

- Gardener: comparative advantage in potatoes (1 kg potato = 0.25 kg meat)
- Farmer: comparative advantage in meat (1 kg meat = 2 kg potatoes)
- Mutually beneficial trade: 1 kg meat ↔ 3 kg potatoes
- Result: both parties consume more than they could produce alone

### Key Figures

- [[David Ricardo]]: introduced the principle of comparative advantage
- [[Adam Smith]]: advocated specialization and trade in "Wealth of Nations"
  - Quote: “What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.”
- [[Invisible Hand]]: theory that self-interest leads to societal benefit

### Summary

- Absolute advantage = efficiency
- Comparative advantage = trade benefit
- Specialization + trade = higher total output
- Principle applies to individuals and nations
