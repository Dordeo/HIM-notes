# 🧠 Principles of Economics (Week 1)
What Is Economics?
• 	The study of how society manages scarce resources to meet unlimited wants.
• 	Divided into:
• 	Microeconomics: decisions of households and firms.
• 	Macroeconomics: economy-wide phenomena (inflation, unemployment, growth).

## The Economic Problem
Every economy must answer:
1. 	What to produce?
2. 	How to produce?
3. 	For whom to produce?
#### Factors of Production
• 	Land: natural resources
• 	Labour: human effort
• 	Capital: tools and structures used in production
### 7 Core Principles
#### People Face Trade-offs
• 	Concept: Choosing one thing means giving up another.
• 	Example: A student deciding between studying for exams or working part-time. More income means less study time, and vice versa.
• 	Implication: Every decision involves a cost — even leisure has an opportunity cost.
#### The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It
• 	Concept: Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative.
• 	Example: Attending university costs tuition, but also the income you could’ve earned working full-time.
• 	Implication: Rational decision-making compares total costs (explicit + implicit) against expected benefits.
#### Rational People Think at the Margin
• 	Concept: Marginal analysis involves small, incremental changes.
• 	Example: A café deciding whether to stay open an extra hour. They weigh the marginal cost (wages, electricity) against marginal revenue (extra sales).
• 	Implication: Optimal decisions are made when marginal benefit ≥ marginal cost.
#### People Respond to Incentives
• 	Concept: Behavior changes when costs or benefits change.
• 	Example: Charging for plastic bags reduces usage. Offering discounts increases purchases.
• 	Implication: Policymakers use incentives to influence behavior (e.g., taxes, subsidies).
#### Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
• 	Concept: Specialization and exchange increase efficiency.
• 	Example: Switzerland trades watches for foreign oil. Each country focuses on what it does best.
• 	Implication: Trade expands consumption possibilities beyond domestic production limits.
#### Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity
• 	Concept: The “invisible hand” guides self-interested individuals to socially beneficial outcomes.
• 	Example: A bakery chooses ingredients and prices based on customer demand, not government orders.
• 	Implication: Decentralized decision-making often leads to efficient resource allocation.
#### Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes
• 	Concept: Market failures (e.g., monopolies, pollution) justify intervention.
• 	Example: Environmental regulations reduce negative externalities. Antitrust laws prevent monopolies.
• 	Implication: Government can promote equity and efficiency — but must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences.


### Cost Types
• 	Explicit: Monetary payments
• 	Implicit: Non-monetary sacrifices
• 	Sunk Costs: Irrecoverable and not part of opportunity cost

# 🧭 Economic Thought & Systems (Week 2)
Why Economists Disagree
• 	Different theories and values lead to varied conclusions.
## Major Schools of Thought
• 	**Mercantilism**: Wealth via gold/silver, protectionism
• 	**Physiocrats**: Circular flow, minimal government
• 	**Classical (Adam Smith)**: Free markets, self-interest, invisible hand
• 	**Marginalist/Neoclassical**: Prices depend on utility and demand
• 	**Marxist**: Labor theory of value, critique of capitalism
• 	**Keynesian**: Government intervention needed during recessions

### Positive vs Normative Analysis
• 	Positive: Describes what is
• 	Normative: Prescribes what should be
Economic Systems


# 🔄 Models & Opportunity Cost (Week 3)

## Economic Models
• 	Simplify reality to understand economic behavior.
• 	Two key models:
• 	Circular Flow Diagram: Shows money and resource movement between households and firms.
• 	Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF): Shows trade-offs in producing two goods.


## PPF Insights
• 	Efficiency: Points on the curve use all resources.
• 	Inefficiency: Points inside the curve show underutilization.
• 	Impossibility: Points outside the curve require more resources or tech.
• 	Opportunity Cost: What is sacrificed when choosing one good over another.
• 	Increasing Opportunity Cost: Resources are not equally suited for all goods → bowed-out curve.
## Economic Growth
• 	Occurs when the PPF shifts outward due to:
• 	More or better resources
• 	Technological improvements
• 	Trade expanding consumption possibilities
