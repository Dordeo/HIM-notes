# Shifters in Demand, Supply, and Market Outcomes

## 1. Demand shifters

A _demand shifter_ is any factor (other than the good’s own price) that causes the entire demand curve to move left or right. When demand increases, the demand curve shifts **right**; when demand decreases, it shifts **left**.​

## Where and when does demand shift?​

- The curve shifts horizontally on the **quantity axis**: right = more demanded at every price, left = less demanded at every price.​
    
- Shift **right (increase in demand)** when, for example: income rises (normal goods), the good becomes more fashionable, the price of a substitute rises, the price of a complement falls, or buyers expect higher future prices / more buyers enter the market.
    
- Shift **left (decrease in demand)** when, for example: income falls (normal goods), the good becomes less popular, the price of a substitute falls, the price of a complement rises, or buyers expect lower future prices / some buyers leave the market.​
    

| Change in demand       | Curve movement (graph)                                   | What happens at every price?                      | Typical reasons (examples)                                                                                                                                | Effect on equilibrium (if supply fixed) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Increase in demand** | Demand curve shifts **right** along the quantity axis. ​ | Quantity demanded is **higher** at every price. ​ | Higher income (normal goods), more favorable tastes, higher price of substitute, lower price of complement, expected higher future prices, more buyers. ​ | **Price ↑, Quantity ↑**.                |
| **Decrease in demand** | Demand curve shifts **left** along the quantity axis. ​  | Quantity demanded is **lower** at price.          | Lower income (normal goods), less favourable tastes, lower price of substitute, higher price of complement, expected lower future prices, fewer buyers. ​ | **Price ↓, Quantity ↓**.                |

Main demand shifters: tastes and preferences, income, prices of related goods, expectations, and number of buyers.​

## 2. Supply shifters

A _supply shifter_ is any factor (other than the good’s own price) that causes the entire supply curve to move left or right. When supply increases, the supply curve shifts **right**; when supply decreases, it shifts **left**.​

## Where and when does supply shift?​

- The curve shifts horizontally on the **quantity axis**: right = more supplied at every price, left = less supplied at every price.

- Shift **right (increase in supply)** when, for example: input costs fall, technology improves, the number of sellers rises, producers receive subsidies, or firms expect lower future prices.

- Shift **left (decrease in supply)** when, for example: input costs rise, technology worsens or is restricted, the number of sellers falls, new taxes/regulation are imposed, or firms expect higher future prices and hold back output.​
    

| Change in supply       | Curve movement (graph)                                   | What happens at every price?                      | Typical reasons (examples)                                                                                                             | Effect on equilibrium (if demand fixed) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Increase in supply** | Supply curve shifts **right** along the quantity axis. ​ | Quantity supplied is **higher** at every price. ​ | Lower input costs, better technology, more sellers, subsidies, expected lower future prices, positive supply shocks. ​                 | **Price ↓, Quantity ↑**. ​              |
| **Decrease in supply** | Supply curve shifts **left** along the quantity axis. ​  | Quantity supplied is **lower** at every price. ​  | Higher input costs, worse/restricted technology, fewer sellers, new taxes/regulations, expected higher future prices, negative supply​ | **Price ↑, Quantity ↓**. ​              |

Main supply shifters: input costs, technology, number of sellers, taxes and subsidies, expectations, and supply shocks.​

## 3. Combined shifts of demand and supply

When demand and supply both shift at the same time, one of the two outcomes (price or quantity) becomes _indeterminate_ (cannot be determined without more information).​

## Summary table of combined shifts​

| Shift in demand | Shift in supply | Curve movements                          | Effect on equilibrium price                                     | Effect on equilibrium quantity                          | Which is indeterminate? |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Increase        | Increase        | Both curves shift **right**.             | Indeterminate (demand ↑ pushes P up, supply ↑ pushes P down). ​ | **Quantity ↑**. ​                                       | **Price**.              |
| Decrease        | Decrease        | Both curves shift **left**. ​            | Indeterminate (demand ↓ pushes P down, supply ↓ pushes P up). ​ | **Quantity ↓**. ​                                       | **Price**.              |
| Increase        | Decrease        | D shifts **right**, S shifts **left**.​  | **Price ↑** (both shifts raise P). ​                            | Indeterminate (demand ↑ raises Q, supply ↓ lowers Q). ​ | **Quantity**.           |
| Decrease        | Increase        | D shifts **left**, S shifts **right**. ​ | **Price ↓** (both shifts lower P).                              | Indeterminate (demand ↓ lowers Q, supply ↑ raises Q). ​ | **Quantity**.           |

**Rule of thumb:**

- Curves shift in the **same direction** → quantity known, price indeterminate.​
    
- Curves shift in **opposite directions** → price known, quantity indeterminate.​

## 4. Surplus and shortage

Market equilibrium is where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied; this gives the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.​

## Surplus (excess supply)

A **surplus** occurs when the market price is **above** equilibrium so quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded. Unsold goods push sellers to cut prices, which reduces quantity supplied and increases quantity demanded until the market returns to equilibrium.​

## Shortage (excess demand)

A **shortage** occurs when the market price is **below** equilibrium so quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied. Buyers compete for the limited goods, bidding up prices; higher prices reduce quantity demanded and increase quantity supplied, moving the market back toward equilibrium.​

## 5. When price and quantity cannot be determined

“Cannot be determined” (indeterminate) means the direction of change in equilibrium price or quantity is unclear because different shifts push it in opposite directions.​

- Price is indeterminate when demand and supply shift in the **same** direction (both right or both left).​
    
- Quantity is indeterminate when demand and supply shift in **opposite** directions (one right, one left).​
    

To resolve an indeterminate case, more information is needed about which shift (demand or supply) is larger, and graphing the shifts is often the easiest way to see this.​
