# 🔄 Economic Models

> Two foundational models used to visualize economic activity and trade-offs.

## 🌀 Circular Flow Model

### Purpose
- Illustrates how money and resources move between households and firms.
- Simplifies real-world transactions into two main flows:
  - **Real Flow**: Goods, services, and factors of production
  - **Monetary Flow**: Payments, wages, rent, profit

### Key Actors
- **Households**:
  - Own and sell factors of production (land, labor, capital)
  - Buy goods and services
- **Firms**:
  - Hire factors of production
  - Produce and sell goods and services

### Market Types
- **Goods & Services Market**: Firms sell, households buy
- **Factor Market**: Households sell, firms buy

## 📈 Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

### Definition
- A graph showing all possible combinations of two goods that can be produced using available resources and technology.

### Core Concepts
- **Efficiency**:
  - Points on the curve use all resources productively.
  - Points inside the curve show underutilization (e.g. unemployment).
- **Impossibility**:
  - Points outside the curve are unattainable with current resources.

### Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost
- Moving along the curve shows what must be sacrificed to produce more of one good.
- **Opportunity Cost**: The amount of one good given up to produce another.

### Curve Shapes
- **Straight Line**: Constant opportunity cost (rare)
- **Bowed Out (Concave)**: Increasing opportunity cost (common due to resource specialization)

## 📊 Economic Growth & PPF Shifts

### Growth Mechanisms
- Increase in quantity or quality of resources (e.g. labor, capital)
- Technological advancement
- Trade expanding consumption possibilities

### Result
- Outward shift of the PPF
- More of both goods can be produced

---

## 🧪 Constant vs Increasing Opportunity Cost

### Constant Opportunity Cost
- Resources are easily adaptable for producing either good
- Results in a straight-line PPF

### Increasing Opportunity Cost
- Resources are not equally suited for all goods
- Results in a bowed-out (concave) PPF

| Concept                    | Description                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Circular Flow              | Interaction between households and firms               |
| PPF                        | Trade-offs in production using limited resources       |
| Opportunity Cost           | What is sacrificed to gain something else              |
| Economic Growth            | Outward shift of PPF due to resource/tech improvements |
| Efficiency vs Inefficiency | On-curve vs inside-curve production                    |
