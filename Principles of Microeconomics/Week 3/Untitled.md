Below the line AC it is inefficient, on the line it is productively efficient, above is impossible.

## Opportunity Cost Types
There are few types of opportunity cost:
- Constant

- Increasing (concave down)

They are self explanatory. The Decreasing one though is very rare and is mostly with two product  in the market have nothing in common and require a lot of completely different things. I believe we are not going over it in this course.
