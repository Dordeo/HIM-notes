Accounting records are based on the actual cost of something. Cost is in a cash- currency or equivalent terms. The value is equal to the price at the time of an item being bought.
#### 2. [[Revenue recognitions Principle ]]
Accounting of the revenue that is done the moment transaction is done from the business's side, not the moment payment is received.

#### 3. [[Expense recognition Principle]]
Expenses are to be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenues help generate, regardless of when the cash is actually paid.

#### 4. [[Full disclosure Principle]]
- Company must disclose all information in its financial statement the could influence user's decision.

## Principles vs Assumptions 
[[ Principles ]] are fundamental truths or rules, often derived from experience or values, that serve as the foundation  for reasoning.

[[ Assumptions ]] are beliefs not necessarily true at all times, but are taken for granted.

### Four assumptions  :
####  1. [[Going-concern assumption]]
The company will continue to exist rather than ever being sold or shut down. (Very Long Time period, 100 years )

#### 2. [[Monetary unit assumption]]
Consistent recording in the same currency, aka monetary unit. 

#### 3. [[Time period assumption]]
A company's life is split into regular periods to report financial results.

#### 4. [[Business entity assumption]]
A business is treated as a separate entity from its owners or other businesses. 

### Constraint
**Means exactly what is means in English, limit or restriction**

#### [[Cost-Benefit Constraint]]
Advantages of an action or decision should outweigh its costs.
