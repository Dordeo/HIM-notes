## Forecasting room availability and demand

To properly forecast one needs to:
**Room availability**
**Occupancy projection** - predicting how many people are going to come
**Market Segmentation** - analyze who is likely to come aka customer type
**Season Variation** - analyze how it differs by season


[[Rack Rate]] = 100% and is a rate at which a room is sold

# Measuring Yield: Essential Formulas

$$
\text{Occupancy Rate} = \frac{\text{Rooms Night Sold}}{\text{Room Nights Available}} 
$$
[[Average Daily Rate]] = $$ \frac{\text{Realized Room Revenue}}{\text{Total Rooms Sold}}$$
$$
\text{Yield Percentage} = \frac{\text{Realzied Room Revenue}}{\text{Potential Room Revenue}}
$$

$$
\text{Revenue Per Avaible Room} = \frac{\text{Realized Room Revenue}}{\text{Number Of Rooms Avaible}}
$$
