## Accounting Fundamentals

### Accounts
[[Accounts]] are the foundation of front office accounting. They represent individual records of financial transactions associated with either guests or non-guests. Guest accounts are created for registered individuals staying at the property, capturing all charges and credits during their stay. Non-guest accounts are maintained for external entities such as companies, online travel agencies (OTAs), or credit card providers. These accounts ensure that every financial interaction is properly tracked and attributed to the correct party.

### Folios
A [[folio]] is the detailed statement of transactions recorded for an account. It serves as the running balance sheet for a guest or entity. There are four primary types:
- [[Guest folio]]: Tracks charges and payments for individual guests. 
- [[Master folio]]: Consolidates charges for groups or events, often linked to multiple guest folios.  
- [[Non-guest folio]]: Used for companies or third-party billing arrangements.  
- [[Employee folio]]: Records internal transactions for staff, such as meals or services.  
Folios are critical because they provide transparency and accountability, showing the chronological order of postings and the evolving balance.

### Vouchers
[[Vouchers]] are formal documents that support each transaction. They provide evidence of charges, corrections, or settlements, ensuring that every posting has a verifiable source. Examples include meal vouchers, paid-out vouchers, or correction vouchers. In practice, vouchers serve as the audit trail, allowing managers and auditors to confirm the legitimacy of entries and maintain financial integrity.

### Point of Sale (POS)
The [[Point of sale system]] is where transactions originate. It can be a restaurant terminal, spa desk, or digital interface. Each POS captures the details of a purchase—item, quantity, price, and applicable taxes—and transmits this data to the front office system. By integrating POS with guest folios, hotels ensure that incidental charges are automatically posted, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.

### Ledgers
[[Ledgers]] are the broader accounting structures that organize folios and accounts.  
- [[Guest Ledger]]: Contains all active guest accounts, reflecting charges and credits during occupancy. It is transient in nature, as balances are settled upon departure.  
- [[City Ledger]]: Holds non-guest accounts, including company billing, credit card settlements, and post-departure charges. Unlike the guest ledger, the city ledger represents account receivables that may remain outstanding until payment is collected.  

Together, these ledgers provide a complete view of the hotel’s financial position, distinguishing between immediate guest balances and longer-term receivables.

## Creation & Maintenance of Accounts
- Folio creation & identification  
- Charge privileges & spending limits , so that guest can pay for products sold at the hotel.
- Credit monitoring (house/floor limits)  
- Account maintenance & adjustments  
- Formula: [[Net Oustanding Balance]]

\text{Net Outsdanding Ballance} = \text{Previous Balance - Credits + Debts}
