# What is Marketing Mix
A [[marketing mix]] is a comprehensive approach that forms a thorough marketing plan. This concept typically involves the well-known FOUR Ps: **product, price, placement, and promotion**.

###### 4 Ps
- Product - what you are selling
- Place - where you are selling
- Price - how much you charge
- Promotion - the way it is presented how well you communicate the value of the product

#### Product
Apart from the product itself the Product category also includes **benefits, supporting features and warranties**. It may also include **brand reputation** or solving customers specific **needs**

Product also has **lifespan** so Product Category is more of a descriptor of the items value and function.

##### Why not focus only on the product?
When a company focuses **only** on the **product** it proposes a lot of risk as the **product** can be **copied** or **improved**. This risk also leads to [[Commodization]].
