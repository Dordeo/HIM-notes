Marketing relies on humans needs or desires.

# There are five needs of desires
**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**

1. Self-Actualisation
2. Esteem Needs 
3. Belonging Needs - being  part of community 
4. Safety Needs
5. Physiological Needs

# Marketing does not create needs
Humans have limited needs but infinite desires.
Marketing influences desires and emotions through symbolic associations.

[[ Symbolic Envelope ]] - collection of meanings, enotions, and status symbols that surround even the most basic needs.

## Example
Louis Viton shirt vs Regular shirt
Price 900$ vs 10$
