# Types of Pricing 
### Cost-Based Pricing 
Setting prices based on the cost of the production plus a certain markup that will make production profitable.

#### [[Mark up]]
There are multiple mark ups that are a part of this strategy.

$$
\text{Mark up} = \frac{\text{Selling Price - Production Cost}}{\text{Production Cost}}$$


[[Mark up]] - amount added to the cost of the product expressed as a percentage of the cost. Mark up is added to generate profit.

##### Fixed Mark up
Standard mark up across all products. For example a company A has a line up of different product and all of them cost 10% more than the production cost. Those 10% is the mark up.

##### Variable Mark up
Mark up is different between products of a company for example good A has a markup of 15% while mark up B has a 20% mark up. This is an example of a variable product.

##### Seasonal Mark up
Mark up that changes not by the product but rather by the season the product is sold. A winter coat is cheaper in the summer than in the winter that is the example of the variable markup.

##### Brand Mark up
Branding provides the opportunity for the companies to increase their profit. For example luxury products may allow for a higher mark up than regular products. This is kind of a luxury tax the company takes for differentiation.

#### Regulated Mark Up
Some products have a mark up that is regulated by the government. For example being pharmaceuticals and utilities. The maximum mark up is regulated though, minimal mark up is not regulated.
