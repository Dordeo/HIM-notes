Marketing relies on humans needs or desires.

# There are five needs of desires
**[[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]**

1. Self-Actualization
2. Esteem Needs 
3. Belonging Needs - being  part of community 
4. Safety Needs
5. Physiological Needs

# Marketing does not create needs
Humans have limited needs but infinite desires.
Marketing influences desires and emotions through symbolic associations.

[[ Symbolic Envelope ]] - collection of meanings, emotions, and status symbols that surround even the most basic needs.

## Example
Louis Viton shirt vs Regular shirt
Price 900$ vs 10$ 

Louis Viton shirt will be bought no matter the price as long as a persons believes it can help them connect with a group of people they want to connect. This is an example of Belonging Need from [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]].

# Types of Beliefs

[[ Functional Belief ]] - Practical, tangible advantages that consumers gain from product features.

[[ Symbolic Belief ]] - Intangible, emotional or social advantages that consumers associate with product features
