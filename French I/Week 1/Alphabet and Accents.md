The Alphabet of the French

## Accents :

Accent **aigu** - é It shortens the sound of e to something like "ay". Closed short sound

Accent **grave** - à, è, ù. This accent is peculiar as it does not change the pronunciation but rather it changes the meaning behind the word. 

Accent **circonflexe** - â, ê, î, ô, û. This accents slightly lengthens the letters sound.

Accent **tréma** - ë, ï, ü. This accent is special because it only appears when two vowels stand together

Accent **cédille** - ç. This accent appears only on a consonant C to change its sound from "K" to a soft "S" sound. It also has always to be before a vowel.
