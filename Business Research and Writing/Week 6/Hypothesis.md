# Hypotheses, Variables & Ethics in Research

## Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a testable prediction that suggests a relationship between variables.

- Example: “Increasing study time improves test scores.”
  - Independent Variable: Study time
  - Dependent Variable: Test scores

## Types of Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No effect or relationship  
  - e.g., “Study time does not affect test scores.”
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: A relationship exists  
  - e.g., “More study time leads to higher test scores.”

## Variables

### Definitions
- **Independent Variable (IV)**: The factor manipulated by the researcher.
- **Dependent Variable (DV)**: The outcome measured.
- **Control Variables**: Factors kept constant to ensure a fair test.

### Example: Plant Growth Study
- IV: Amount of water  
- DV: Plant height  
- Controls: Soil type, sunlight, pot size

## Ethics in Research

### Core Principles
- Protects dignity, rights, and welfare of participants.
- Requires informed consent, honesty, and confidentiality.
- Avoids harm, deception, and coercion.

### Ethical Responsibilities
- Ensure privacy and transparency.
- Prevent bias and report data truthfully.
- Example of unethical research: Milgram obedience experiment.

## Case Example: Marketing Campaign Hypothesis

- Hypothesis: “If we launch a targeted social media campaign, sales will increase by 15% in 3 months.”
- Independent Variable: Campaign presence and reach  
- Dependent Variable: Sales figures and conversion rates  
- Ethical Practice: Pilot test with informed consent and honest reporting

## Conclusion
- Hypotheses guide research direction.
- Variables define and structure the study.
- Ethics ensure credibility and participant protection.
