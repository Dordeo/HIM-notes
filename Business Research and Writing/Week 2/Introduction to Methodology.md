# Research 

[[ Population ]] -  the group of something you do  a research on.

[[ Sample ]] - subset of population you test.

[[ Sample Size ]] - the amount of test subjects in the sample.

### Types of Research

1. Basic Research - Expends knowledge without immediate application.
2. [[Applied Research]] - solves specific problems.
3. [[ Quantitative Research ]] - Numerical data and statistical analysis 
4. [[ Qualitive Research ]] -  Meanings, experiences and perspectives
5. Mixed method - all of them in different proportions

### Types of Research by Objective
1. [[ Explorative Research ]] :
    - Purpose: Discover and investigate phenomena that are poorly understood
    - Use: when little known about the topic, developing new theories, investigating new trends. 
2. [[ Explanatory Research ]] :
     - Purpose: Identify causes, test casual relationship and explain why something happens
     - Use: testing hypothesis about cause-and-effect relationships and validation of theoretical models
3. [[ Descriptive Research ]] :
     - Purpose : Systematically describe a reality, behavior, or population 
     - Use : When you need to create a detailed profile or establish baseline information about a phenomenon

# Types of Reasoning
## Inductive
Direction: From specific observations → General theory
Logic: Build theoretical understanding empirical patterns observed in the field
Common in: Qualitative research, explorative studios

## Deductive 
Direction: From general theory → Specific test
Logic: Test existing theoretical predictions against empirical reality
Common in: Quantitative research, experimental designs, confirmatory studies

# Steps in the Research Process
1. Identify and define the research problem.
2. Review existing literature.
3. Formulate hypotheses or research questions.
4. Design the methodology.
5. Collect and analyze data.
6. Interpret findings and draw conclusions.
7. Report and present results.

### Research Design
Framework or blueprint for conducting research.
- Describes how data will be collected, measured, and analyzed.
- Types: Descriptive, Experimental, Correlational
- Case Study

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and Questionnaires
- Interviews
- Observations
- Experiments
- Document and Archival Analysis

#### Quantitative VS. Qualitive Methods
##### Quantitative:
- Objective, uses numerical data.
- Employs statistical analysis.
##### Qualitative:
- Subjective, explores depth and context.
- Uses interviews, open-ended questions.
