# What is Identity
[[Personal or Individual Identity]] is how we define Who We are: the collection of beliefs, values , experiences and affiliations that make us feel like ourselves. These are the things that make you unique from the others.

[[ Social or Collective Identity]] :  Your culture, family traditions, language, religious or spiritual beliefs and core values all contribute to forming your sense of self. Identity develops through interaction with others.

### Individual vs Collective Identity

- Success measured by individual merit

#### Collectivistic Culture

- Relationships, family and community needs
- Success by Welfare and cohesion
