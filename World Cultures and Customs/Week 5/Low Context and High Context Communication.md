# Words don't mean what they say 
Words can hide the meaning behind themselves. For example: 'Its fine.' can hide anger, sadness, sarcastic disagreement and etc.

Tone is what differentiates the word from its potential meaning. 

## High-Context Culture
Communication relies on non verbal components:
- Experience
- Cues
- Relationship

Basically a culture that requires you to read between the lines.
