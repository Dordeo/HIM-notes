# Political and Regulatory Influences in Finance

## Political Risks
- Geopolitical tensions, trade tariffs, and economic sanctions can destabilize global markets.
- These risks lead to volatility and potential financial crises.

## Supranational Bodies
- Institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank promote global economic cooperation.
- They provide financial assistance and policy guidance to nations.

## Social and Technological Disruptions

### Financial Inclusion & Digital Habits
- Mobile banking and digital wallets are expanding access to financial services.
- Generation Z’s digital-first behavior is reshaping service models.

### ESG Investing & Participatory Capitalism
- Emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors is transforming investment strategies.
- Encourages corporate responsibility and stakeholder engagement.

### AI & Machine Learning
- AI enhances:
  - Credit scoring
  - Fraud detection
  - Personalized financial advice

### Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
- Distributed ledger technology enables Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
- Challenges traditional banking infrastructure.
- Controlled by trust, not the government or other regulators.

### Open Banking & API Integration
- APIs allow secure data sharing between institutions.
- Drives innovation through third-party financial applications.

### Externalities in Economics

[[Externalities]] are unintended side effects of economic activities that affect third parties not directly involved in the transaction. These effects are not reflected in market prices, leading to market inefficiencies.

#### Types of Externalities

- **Negative Externalities**: Harmful effects on others.
  - Examples:
    - Air pollution from factories
    - Traffic congestion
    - Noise from construction
  - Result: Overproduction of harmful goods

- **Positive Externalities**: Beneficial effects on others.
  - Examples:
    - Vaccination reduces disease spread
    - Education improves societal productivity
    - Beekeeping enhances nearby crop yields
  - Result: Underproduction of beneficial goods

#### Why Externalities Matter

- Markets fail to allocate resources efficiently when externalities are present.
- Government intervention is often needed to correct these failures.

#### Policy Tools

- **Pigouvian Tax**: Imposed on negative externalities (e.g., carbon tax)
- **Subsidies**: Offered for positive externalities (e.g., education grants)

#### Real-World Example

> A factory emits pollutants into the air. The private cost includes labor and materials, but the social cost includes health and environmental damage. Because the factory doesn’t pay for these external costs, it overproduces, harming society.

#### Summary

Externalities can be positive or negative and arise from production or consumption. They lead to market failures and often require policy solutions to balance private incentives with social outcomes.

### Market Power

Market power is a firm's ability to influence the price of a good or service rather than accepting it as given by the market.

### Industry Convergence
- Traditional banks are evolving into tech-driven enterprises.
- Adoption of AI, cloud computing, and data analytics is key to competing with FinTechs.

### Green Finance & Sustainable Banking
- ESG criteria guide capital toward sustainable development.
- Banks are aligning with climate goals and social impact.

### Geopolitical Influences
- De-dollarization and global power shifts affect financial stability.
- International competition creates new market dynamics.

### Career Planning & Resources
- Future finance roles require:
  - Data science
  - Cybersecurity
  - Sustainable finance expertise

## Mini Case Study: Post-Crash Regulation

### Basel III Reforms
- Raised minimum capital requirements:
  - From 2% (Basel II) to 4.5% common equity
  - Plus 2.5% buffer → total 7%
- Improved capital quality:
  - Tier 1: Shareholders’ equity & retained earnings
  - Tier 2: Revaluation reserves
  - Tier 3: Phased out post-2008

### Addressing Fundamental Failures
- Regulations target:
  - Excessive risk-taking
  - Insufficient capital
  - “Too big to fail” institutions

### Navigating Stricter Controls
- Increased compliance costs and capital requirements
- May reduce lending capacity and slow innovation

### The Regulation Debate
- Balance needed between:
  - Financial stability & consumer protection
  - Economic growth & market efficiency

### Reflection Prompt
> How might FinTechs be impacted differently by these regulations compared to traditional banks?
