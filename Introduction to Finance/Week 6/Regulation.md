# Government Regulations in the Economy

## What Are They?
Government regulations are rules created by the state to guide how businesses and markets operate. They help maintain fairness, safety, and stability.

# Externalities

## What Are Externalities?
Externalities are side effects of economic activities that affect people who are not directly involved in the transaction.

## Positive Externalities
These bring benefits to others:
- Education: Improves society’s skill level.
- Vaccination: Reduces disease spread.

## Negative Externalities
These impose costs on others:
- Pollution: Harms public health.
- Noise: Disturbs nearby residents.

## Government Response
To manage externalities, governments may:
- Tax negative externalities (e.g. carbon tax)
- Subsidize positive ones (e.g. education grants)
- Regulate harmful activities (e.g. pollution limits)

These are all regulations. 

# Crypto Currency

Crypto currency is a type of financial asset that is not very well regulated. Because of its anonymous nature it is difficult to subject it to laws and regulations as the government and other committees have no idea how they can be regulated, as there is no one to be held accountable.

There are 3 main types of how crypto currency is being regulated:
## Completely Blocked
In some countries the crypto currencies are considered illegal and is not recognized as a legal asset. Sometimes only trading crypto is banned, owning is alright.

## Partially Legal
Mostly in EU the crypto currencies are limited, only few are allowed to enter crypto market. And when they enter the total amount of flow is restricted. Is taxed but no clear rules on how.

## Fully Legal
Crypto currency is considered an actual currency on a legal level. It is to attract the investments and potential growth. However it brings a lot of risk as illegally earned money can be washed with crypto.  Considered as an asset, and is taxable.
