## Week 4: Policy & Regulation

## Political Influences

Geopolitical tensions, trade policy, sanctions affect markets and capital flows. IMF and World Bank coordinate global financial policy.

## Technological Disruption

**Digital Finance** - mobile banking expands financial access. **ESG** - environmental/social/governance factors reshape investment strategies. **AI** - revolutionizes credit scoring and fraud detection. **Blockchain** - distributed ledgers create DeFi alternatives. **APIs** - enable data sharing and innovation.

Banks adopt AI/cloud/analytics to compete with FinTech. ESG criteria redirect capital toward sustainability. Geopolitical shifts create new financial challenges.

## Basel III Regulation

Capital requirements increased from 2% to 4.5% core equity + 2.5% buffer = 7% minimum. **Tier 1** (equity/retained earnings) most reliable. **Tier 2** (subordinated debt/revaluations). **Tier 3** (lower-quality debt) phased out post-2008. Targets excessive risk-taking and "too big to fail" problem. Balance between stability and economic dynamism.

## Topic 5: Personal Finance

## Five Pillars

**Earn** - income generation. **Save** - defer consumption for goals. **Spend** - consume goods/services. **Invest** - allocate capital for returns. **Protect** - manage risk via insurance/diversification.

## Net Worth

Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth. Snapshot of financial position. Changes through income, saving, investment returns, debt repayment.

## Financial Psychology

Attitudes toward money influence decisions. Cognitive biases (loss aversion, anchoring) distort judgment.

## Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates

**Nominal** = stated rate (ignores inflation). **Real** = inflation-adjusted rate. Formula: Real ≈ Nominal - Inflation. Example: 3% nominal - 2% inflation = 1% real return. Inflation erodes purchasing power; managers assess real returns.

## 50/30/20 Budget Rule

50% essential needs (housing, food, utilities), 30% discretionary wants (entertainment), 20% savings/debt repayment.

## Cash Flow Tracking

Reveals spending patterns, identifies optimization, enables goal progress. Methods: manual ledger, spreadsheet, budgeting apps.

## Spending Leaks

Identify via statement review (subscriptions, memberships), expense categorization, micro-tracking, necessity testing.

## Topic 6: Credit & Debt

## Credit Instruments

**Credit Cards** - revolving credit, flexible borrowing, interest on unpaid balance. **Loans** - installment credit, fixed payments (principal + interest), specific purposes.

## Interest Rate Types

**Fixed Rate** - constant throughout loan life. Advantages: payment certainty, rate protection. Disadvantage: higher initial rates. **Variable Rate** - changes with market indices. Advantages: lower initial rates, benefit from rate declines. Disadvantages: payment uncertainty, refinancing risk.

## Credit Scores (300-850)

Measures creditworthiness from credit history. Higher = lower risk = better rates. Build via: on-time payments, low utilization (<30%), longer history, credit mix, limited new applications.

## Good vs. Bad Debt

**Good Debt** - appreciating assets or income-generating (education, mortgages, business loans). **Bad Debt** - depreciating consumption with high rates (credit cards, payday loans, car loans).

## Debt Types Comparison

**Student Loans** - Pros: education access, low rates, flexible repayment. Cons: long-term, interest accrual. **Auto Loans** - Pros: transportation, credit building. Cons: rapid depreciation, negative equity risk. **Credit Cards** - Pros: convenience, rewards. Cons: high interest if unpaid, overspending risk.

## Credit Myths

Closing old cards harms score (shortens history, increases utilization). Maintaining balance helps score (False - pay in full). Avoid all debt (False - good debt builds wealth). Checking own score harms it (False - soft inquiries don't affect score). Bad credit is permanent (False - rebuilds with responsible habits).

## Topic 7: Savings & Goal Setting

## Savings Theory

Deferred consumption funding future expenditures and [[Topic 8|investments]]. [[Week 4|Inflation]] erodes purchasing power; real returns required via investment, not cash savings.

## Emergency Funds

Liquid reserves (3-6 months expenses) in accessible accounts prevent forced high-cost borrowing during disruptions.

## Savings Vehicles

**Savings Accounts** - highly liquid, minimal returns, accessible. **CDs** - fixed rates for set periods, early withdrawal penalties. **Money Market Funds** - higher yields than savings, moderate liquidity.

## Goal Framework

**Short-term** (1-3 years) - vacation, appliance. **Medium-term** (3-10 years) - vehicle, home down payment. **Long-term** (10+ years) - retirement, education. Time horizon determines [[Topic 8|asset allocation]].

## Inflation Impact

Reduces money's purchasing power. Savings earning below inflation rates experience real losses. Example: CHF 10,000 at 0% interest with 2% inflation loses ~18% purchasing power over 10 years.

## Life Cycle Savings

**Age 20** - emergency savings, education debt repayment. **Age 30-40** - asset accumulation, insurance, long-term investing. **Age 50-60** - retirement maximization, risk reduction.

## Retirement Vehicles

**State Pension (1st Pillar)** - basic social security income. **Company Pension (2nd Pillar)** - employer/employee contributions. **Individual Savings (3rd Pillar)** - voluntary retirement accounts with tax benefits.

## Topic 8: Investment Principles

## Risk-Return Trade-off

Higher risk = higher expected return. Lower risk = lower returns. Time horizon affects [[Topic 8|risk tolerance]] - longer periods absorb greater volatility.

## Asset Classes

**Equities** - company ownership, daily price fluctuations, highest long-term returns. **Fixed Income** - debt obligations with coupons, inverse relationship with rates. **Real Estate** - rental income + appreciation. **Alternatives** - different return drivers, diversification benefit.

## Portfolio Construction

**Asset Allocation** - percentage distribution across classes determines risk/returns more than security selection. **Diversification** - spreads investments across assets/sectors/geographies, reduces idiosyncratic risk. **Rebalancing** - periodic adjustment to targets forces systematic buying low/selling high.

## Price Discovery

Security prices reflect available information and investor expectations. Prices adjust continuously as new information emerges.

## Topic 9: Taxation

## Income Classification

**Ordinary Income** (wages, interest) taxed at [[Topic 9|marginal tax rates]]. Progressive taxation: higher earners face higher rates. **Capital Gains** (investment profits) favored if held 1+ years. **Dividends** receive preferential treatment.

## Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Traditional Accounts** (401k, traditional IRA) - deductible contributions reduce current taxable income, tax-deferred growth. **Roth Accounts** (Roth IRA, Roth 401k) - after-tax contributions, tax-free growth/withdrawals. **HSAs** - triple advantage: deductible, tax-free growth, tax-free medical withdrawals. **529 Plans** - tax-free growth for education.

## Tax Planning

**Income Timing** - defer income to lower-income years, accelerate deductions. **Asset Location** - place tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts. **Loss Harvesting** - realize losses to offset gains, reducing [[Topic 9|capital gains tax]].

## Conceptual Interconnections

## Policy Transmission

[[Week 4|Federal Reserve]] rate changes cascade through system: affects all [[Topic 6|borrowing costs]] → changes [[Topic 7|savings incentives]] → adjusts [[Topic 8|asset prices]] → shifts [[Topic 9|tax consequences]].

## Debt and Leverage

[[Topic 6|Debt decisions]] reflect expectations about [[Topic 8|asset returns]]. Borrowing for appreciating assets (education, real estate) creates leverage amplifying returns. Consumption borrowing creates financial drag.

## Taxation and Decisions

[[Topic 9|Tax treatment]] influences all choices: [[Topic 7|savings vs. consumption]], [[Topic 6|debt vs. equity]], [[Topic 8|investment selection]]. Understanding [[Topic 9|marginal tax rates]] enables optimization
