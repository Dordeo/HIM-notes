# Types of goods
## Private good
- [[Private good]]: A good that is excludable and rivalrous; owners can restrict access, and one person’s use reduces what remains for others. 
- Example: Items in a supermarket such as food or clothing. 

## Public good
- [[Public good]]: A good that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous; people cannot be feasibly prevented from using it, and one person’s use does not reduce availability for others. 
- Examples from the board: Infrastructure, justice, army. 

## Common good
- [[Common good]] (common-pool resource): A good that is non-excludable but rivalrous; many people can access it, but each person’s use diminishes what is left for others. 
- Example from the board: Fish in the ocean. 

# Market consequences
## Natural monopoly
- [[Natural monopoly]]: A market where one firm can supply the entire demand at lower cost than multiple competing firms, usually because of very high fixed costs and strong economies of scale. 
- Example from the board: Water distribution networks. 

## Market failure and externalities
- [[Market failure]]: A situation in which unregulated markets do not allocate resources efficiently, so total surplus is lower than it could be. 
- [[Externality]]: A cost or benefit that affects third parties who are not directly involved in a transaction, such as pollution or vaccination spillovers. 

# Tax essentials

## Direct tax vs indirect tax

### [[Direct tax]]
Collected on income or wealth (for example income tax, corporate tax, wealth tax) and often designed so that higher incomes face higher rates.

### [[Indirect tax]]
Collected when spending on goods and services (for example VAT or excise on fuel, alcohol and tobacco) and tends to raise substantial revenue but can weigh more heavily on lower incomes.

## Progressive taxation and tax brackets

### [[Progressive taxation]]
Higher marginal rates apply only to higher slices of income, not to the entire income.

### Bracketed example
0–20 000 at 0%, 20 001–50 000 at 10%, and 50 001–100 000 at 20%.  
For an income of 60 000: 0% on the first 20 000, 10% on the next 30 000 (3 000), and 20% on the last 10 000 (2 000).  
Total tax 5 000 and effective rate ≈ 8.3%.

## Example tax calculation

### Inputs
Gross income 70 000, social deductions 7 000, professional expense deductions 3 000.  
Taxable income 60 000.  
With a flat illustrative rate of 15%, tax is 9 000 and net income is about 51 000.

### Formulas
$$\text{Taxable income} = \text{Gross income} - \text{Social deductions} - \text{Professional deductions}$$  
$$\text{Tax} = \text{Tax rate} \times \text{Taxable income}$$  
$$\text{Net income} = \text{Gross income} - \text{Tax}$$

## Filing status

### [[Filing status]]
Determines how income, deductions and tax scales are applied, so people with the same gross income can owe different taxes.

### Typical statuses
Single.  
Married or registered partnership (often joint taxation).  
Parent with dependent children (extra deductions).  
Independent worker (more complex reporting of income and expenses).

## Legal tax optimization

### [[Legal tax optimization]]
(Tax planning) arranges income and expenses within the law to reduce the tax burden, distinct from fraud.

### Common tools
Mortgage interest deductions.  
Contributions to private pension “third pillar”.  
Continuing education deductions.  
Timing some income or expenses across years.

## Personal checklist: financial growth

### Core actions
Build an emergency fund covering about 3–6 months of living costs.  
Invest early in tax‑advantaged retirement accounts.  
Prioritise repayment of high‑interest debt.

### Ongoing habits
Use a budget.  
Review insurance coverage.  
Monitor credit.  
Leverage tools such as budgeting apps, high‑yield savings accounts and simple investment platforms.
