# Introduction
Listening to a a guest lecture about competitive rowing, I was astonished. Not only due to the sportsmen's dedication to their craft but also because of the communication techniques they have used to deliver information. In this essay I am going to analyse the communication techniques used, behaviour, challenges and reflect upon them. In the end I will also provide a potential sponsorship pitch outline, for the athletes.

## Part A
This section examines the techniques of effective and ineffective communication observed during the guest lecture.
### Good Examples of Communication
#### Digital and Physical Aids
The athletes used visual and tangible materials to strengthen their message. Photographs of Olympic and Swiss championship events provided context and helped the audience visualize their experiences. A video showing the athletes’ thought processes during competition added emotional depth and made the lecture more memorable. Passing around a medal served as physical evidence of their achievements, reinforcing credibility and trust. These aids transformed abstract ideas into concrete experiences, ensuring the audience remained engaged and convinced of the speakers’ authority.
#### Feedback Loops
Throughout the lecture, the athletes asked questions to the students. This technique allowed them to pause, check comprehension, and reinforce key points. It also gave the audience time to process information, preventing overload. Feedback loops created a two‑way exchange rather than a one‑sided presentation, which improved retention and encouraged active participation.
#### Kinesics (Non‑Verbal Communication)
Non‑verbal cues such as hand gestures, posture, and eye contact played a crucial role. These behaviours compelled the audience to pay closer attention and emphasized important parts of the lecture. As discussed in class, non‑verbal communication accounts for a majority of meaning transfer. In this case, gest7ures during explanations of daily routines and competition rules made the information more vivid and easier to remember.
#### Carefully Curated Vocabulary
The athletes deliberately repeated key words such as dedication, commitment, patience, competition, and mindset. These terms carried emotional weight and acted as anchors for recall. By weaving them consistently into the lecture, the speakers created thematic motifs that highlighted the values central to their careers. This repetition ensured that the audience left with clear takeaways, both intellectual and emotional.

### Bad Examples of Communication
#### Information Overload
Despite the strong structure, the lecture occasionally suffered from excessive detail. For example, during the competition layout phase, the athletes shifted back and forth between describing routines and competition rules, repeating similar points. This disrupted the flow and made the presentation feel chaotic. As a result, much of the information was lost — only a fraction remained memorable. Effective communication requires prioritization and sequencing; here, the abundance of detail diluted the impact.
#### Vague Instructions vs. Feedback Loops
While feedback loops were used effectively, the instructions given to students were unclear. The audience was not told explicitly whether to focus on communication techniques or the lecture content itself. This vagueness caused confusion: some students, including myself, concentrated on identifying techniques rather than absorbing the lecture’s substance. Consequently, comprehension of the overall message was reduced. Clear guidance at the beginning would have aligned expectations and improved learning outcomes.
## Part B
Behavioural impact on the lecture. Well for one, the lecturers were clearly dedicated to their discipline. Motivation has made them prepare a lot and it was noticeable in the agenda they have followed. Agenda has made it easier for students to capture the idea behind the lecture. Both lecturers were also brimming with confidence earned through dedication to their sport. Their confidence in themselves have influence the tone be more rigid and hence the delivery of the information was good and memorable. For example the story telling of their daily training regime was very detailed and clearly shows the pride both athletes take in their own perceptions of the work.

## Part C
Possible challenges may include but not limited to:
#### Lack of Metrics
The presentation lacks metrics, their fundraising idea is good, but it does not go over the details, like expected revenue and marketing strategy. Some cultures require evidence to continue with the deal. Procuring these information may increase the likely hood of success.

#### Q&A section
The feedback loop introduces interruptions with which not all cultures are comfortable with.  Making a specific Q&A Session at the end of the lecture would prove beneficial.

#### Non-verbal communication
This presentation is meant to target peers. In professional setting more restraint with the gestures and hand movements will be valued more. Especially the information must be curated a lot more, condensed and delivered at a slower pace.  

#### Space
Space in which the lecture was conducted was also severely limiting the additional value one could gain by improving the environment. For example providing common amenities such as bottled water, pens and paper will make a good impact on the listener.


## Part D
For me personally the lecture was a bit underwhelming. The main cause of this was, you guessed it the time, we had it at the very end of a 4 class day. So constructive reflection is not possible in my situation but here goes the reflection on my tired self. First and fore most, loss of attention. I pride myself on being an active listening and ability to multitask. But this lecture has proven me wrong: I cant actively listen while tracking and noting down communication styles. But the thing I am good at is note taking.  Believe it or not, my notes may be messy but they do give me an edge when I am writing this style of essay.

Strength:
Notes
Ability to focus on small things

Weakness:
CAN NOT MULTITASK WHILE FOCUS MODE IS ACTIVE

## Part E

If I am to make a pitch I would rather make it like an agenda:
- Introduction of both athletes
- Deliver the Agenda that is below
- Talk about the goal
- Deliver the problem which is in the way of the goal
- Talk about the history of both athletes
- Talk about their expertise in the matter and deliver a possible solutions
- Q&A Session 
- Thank the potential sponsorship team for their attention
